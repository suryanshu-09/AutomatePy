# Automate.Py
This repo contains all my notes from the ISTE workshop on 14th May, 23 called Automate.Py
The workshop is centered around basic machine learning algorithms and aims to get us familiar with all the processes while implementing machine learning.

It contains 5 csv files which are used for data visualisation and prediction. The python code has been written in Jupyter Notebooks and the csv files have to be manually uploaded and their locations need to be updated accordingly in the code.
